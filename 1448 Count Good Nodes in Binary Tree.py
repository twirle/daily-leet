# Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

# Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
# Root Node (3) is always a good node.
# Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
# Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
# Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

# Example 3:
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Root is considered as good.
